        <h1>First post!</h1>
        <p>This is the first post, meant to test the basic design of the web page. It is also to test the formatting of my CSS as I progress on developing myself. It is very <em>important</em> that is I emphasize this as a milestone of personal development. 1 week ago I would consider <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbv> to be completely unreadable and unusable and after some moderate practice and daily online lessons, I've achieved this modern beginning.</p>

        <p>Above, I have included a random image I took in March on my first (and potentially last) visit to Bulgaria. The small fishing boat making its way across the bay as the glaring sun shone above in the vista of the great Burgas bay. Wouldn't that be the life, eh?</p>
